Note: when referring to a folder in gitbash we will say directory instead

Terminal Commands:

ls - the list command. It will list everything in your current directory
mkdir - the make directory command (aka make a new folder)
cd - the change directory command, allows you to go to other directories
pwd - prints the directory you are currently in
touch - the command to create a new file
code - the command to open a directory in VSCode
git add . - ALL changes in ALL files get added
